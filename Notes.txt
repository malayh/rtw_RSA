    - Coprime
        - A and B are coprime if they don't share any common divisor.
    - Euler's totient function
        - phi(N) = number of integers less than N which are coprime to N
        - if N is prime phi(N) = N - 1 , because for N to be prime none of the the numbers < N will divide N
        - phi is multiplicative, i.e. phi(A*B) = phi(A) * phi(B)

        - if N = A*B where A and B are prime, phi(N) = phi(A*B) = phi(A) * phi(B) = (A-1)*(B-1)
            - This means if you know the prime factorization of N calculating phi(N) is easy 

    - Euler's theorem
        - m ^ phi(N) =~ 1 mod N

        -  m ^ (k*phi(N)) =~ 1 mod N (why?)
        => (m*m) ^ (k*phi(N)) =~ m mod N
        => m ^ (k*phi(N)+1) =~ m mod N

    - Modular expontiations
        - (m^e) mod N =~ c (=~ means congruent to)
        - (c^d) mod N =~ m

        - ( (m^e)^d ) mod N =~ m 
        => (m^(ed)) mod N =~ m

    - Steps
        - Step 1: Select two giant prime numbers e,d. Calc N = e*d
            - N is the public key
